This is implementation for Project: Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing
The Article Analyzer is a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles by url. Using an API called meaning cloud, for demo https://evaluate-news-nlp-one.vercel.app

The goal of this project is to practice with:
